This is our logo, business plan, and the first draft of our first semester of fifth grade curriculum. Let's refine.


Strategized CyberSmrt's nonprofit mission and curriculum refinement.
12s








This is incredible work! I can see the depth and thought that's gone into CyberSmrt. Let me update your website with the real mission, programs, and impact metrics from your business plan.

CyberSmrt Nonprofit Website
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 2
Perfect! I've updated your website with CyberSmrt's real mission, programs, and funding goals. The site now accurately reflects:

Key Updates:

Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned 501(c)(3) status prominently featured
Real mission statement from your business plan
Six authentic program cards (K-12 Curriculum, MSSP-lite, Workforce Dev, Community Outreach, Train-the-Trainer, Partnerships)
$400K funding goal with clear purpose
Actual contact info and EIN
Professional footer with all links
What would you like to refine next? I can help with:

Curriculum Materials - Convert Tony's feedback into actionable updates (those "I can" statements, mastery rubrics, family engagement trackers)
Investor Pitch Deck - Transform your business plan into a compelling presentation
Grant Proposals - Target specific funding opportunities (education grants, veteran-focused, cybersecurity workforce)
Marketing Collateral - One-pagers, program brochures, partnership proposals
Website Expansion - Add pages for: About Team, Curriculum Preview, Partner With Us, Impact Dashboard
Educator Resources - Build out those slide decks, vocabulary cards, and assessment rubrics Tony mentioned
What's your top priority right now?

Can you add a section of rotating logos for our partners?


Strategized dynamic partner logo section for website design.



Plotted CSS styling and animations for partner logos.

Perfect! I've added a smooth, auto-scrolling partners section that includes:

Featured Partners:

NEAAAT - Charter School Partner
Tenable - Security Tooling
ISC² - Certification Alignment
CompTIA - Certification Alignment
SANS - Training Partnership
ISACA - Certification Alignment
KC7 Cyber - Education Collaboration
sIQurity AI - Technology Partner
Features:

Infinite smooth scrolling animation (30s loop)
Pauses on hover for easier viewing
Each logo card has a hover effect with scale and glow
Labels show each partner's role
Responsive design
To add real logos later: Just replace the <div class="logo-box"> content with <img src="partner-logo.png" alt="Partner Name"> and the styling will adapt perfectly.

The partners section sits right before your Programs section, creating a natural flow showing credibility before diving into what you offer.

Want me to adjust the animation speed, add more partners, or modify the styling?

Include a focus on helping underserved communities also


Strategized highlighting CyberSmrt's commitment to underserved communities.



Plotted CSS strategy for equity-focused section design.


Refined community outreach program to highlight underserved groups.


Refined CTA to emphasize equity and community support.

Excellent! I've added a powerful "Who We Serve" section that puts your equity focus front and center. Here's what's new:

New Features:
1. Dedicated Equity Section (between Mission and Stats)

Six community categories you serve:
Under-Resourced Schools (inner-city & rural)
Community Nonprofits (protecting sensitive data)
Small Businesses (facing 350% more attacks)
Youth & Families (career pathways, not just awareness)
Seniors & Elderly (scam targets)
Rural Communities (broadband expanding, security lagging)
2. Impact Statistics Callout

47% of small companies have NO security budget
27% of nonprofits experienced breaches
41% of small businesses were attacked last year
Bold statement: "We meet communities where they are"
3. Updated Language Throughout

CTA headline: "Close the Cybersecurity Equity Gap"
Funding goal now specifies: "underserved nonprofits," "career changers from disadvantaged backgrounds," "communities that need it most"
Community Outreach program emphasizes: "inner-city schools, rural community training, multilingual resources"
Visual Design:

Gradient background with subtle glow effect
Hover animations on each community card
Clean grid layout that's fully responsive
Stats presented in large, impactful numbers
This section now makes it crystal clear that CyberSmrt isn't just another cybersecurity nonprofit—you're specifically built to serve communities that others overlook. It's your competitive differentiator and mission core.

Want to adjust the communities highlighted, add testimonials from underserved partners, or modify anything else?

Walk me through setting up my github repo and getting this page live hosted through cloudflare


Mapped out GitHub and Cloudflare hosting strategy step-by-step.


I'll walk you through the complete setup process step-by-step!

Part 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository
Step 1: Create a New Repository
Go to github.com and sign in (or create an account)
Click the "+" button in the top right → "New repository"
Configure your repo:
Repository name: cybersmrt-website (or whatever you prefer)
Description: "CyberSmrt nonprofit website - Securing the Underserved"
Visibility: Public (required for free Cloudflare Pages)
Initialize: Check ✅ "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository"
Step 2: Add Your Website Files
Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

In your new repository, click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it: index.html
Copy the entire HTML from the artifact and paste it into the file editor
Scroll down, add commit message: "Initial website launch"
Click "Commit new file"
Option B: Using Git Command Line (If you're comfortable with terminal)

bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cybersmrt-website.git
cd cybersmrt-website

# Create index.html file
# (Paste the HTML content from the artifact into this file)

# Add and commit
git add index.html
git commit -m "Initial website launch"
git push origin main
Part 2: Deploy with Cloudflare Pages
Step 3: Connect Cloudflare to GitHub
Go to dash.cloudflare.com and sign in (or create free account)
In the left sidebar, click "Workers & Pages"
Click "Create application"
Select the "Pages" tab
Click "Connect to Git"
Click "Connect GitHub" (you'll authorize Cloudflare to access your repos)
Select your cybersmrt-website repository
Step 4: Configure Build Settings
On the setup page:

Project name: cybersmrt (this becomes your URL: cybersmrt.pages.dev)
Production branch: main
Build settings:
Framework preset: None
Build command: (leave empty)
Build output directory: /
Click "Save and Deploy"

Step 5: Wait for Deployment
Cloudflare will build and deploy your site (takes ~30 seconds)
You'll see a success message with your live URL: https://cybersmrt.pages.dev
Click the URL to view your live site! 🎉
Part 3: Add Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)
If you own cybersmrt.org:
In your Cloudflare Pages project, go to "Custom domains"
Click "Set up a custom domain"
Enter: www.cybersmrt.org
Cloudflare will provide DNS records
Add these records in your domain registrar:
CNAME record: www → cybersmrt.pages.dev
Wait for DNS propagation (5 minutes - 48 hours, usually ~10 min)
If you need to buy the domain:
Check if available at Cloudflare Registrar or Namecheap
Purchase the domain
Follow the custom domain setup above
Part 4: Future Updates (Super Easy!)
Every time you want to update the website:

GitHub Web Method:

Go to your repo on GitHub
Click index.html
Click the pencil icon (Edit)
Make your changes
Scroll down → "Commit changes"
Cloudflare automatically rebuilds and deploys in ~30 seconds ✨
Git Command Line:

bash
# Make changes to index.html locally
git add index.html
git commit -m "Updated programs section"
git push origin main
# Cloudflare auto-deploys!
Bonus: Adding Your Logo Image
Once you have your actual logo file (not just the SVG code):

In your GitHub repo, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Upload your logo (e.g., cybersmrt-logo.png)
Update the <svg> section in index.html to:
html
   <img src="cybersmrt-logo.png" alt="CyberSmrt Logo" class="logo-shield">
Commit the changes
Quick Troubleshooting
Issue: "Site not loading after deployment"

Fix: Check the deployment logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
Issue: "Custom domain not working"

Fix: Verify DNS records are correct and wait up to 48 hours for propagation
Issue: "Changes not showing up"

Fix: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clear cache
What You'll Have When Done:
✅ Professional website live at cybersmrt.pages.dev
✅ Automatic HTTPS security
✅ Global CDN (super fast worldwide)
✅ Unlimited bandwidth (free forever)
✅ Automatic deployments on every GitHub commit
✅ Version control for all changes

Total cost: $0 (unless you add a custom domain, ~$10/year)

What's Your Current Status?
Let me know where you are:

 Repository cloned locally?
 index.html created?
 Previewing with Live Server?
 Ready to push to GitHub?
 Ready to deploy to Cloudflare?
I'm here to help troubleshoot any errors or walk through the next steps!

$ git push origin main
remote: Permission to cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git denied to tony-siqurity-ai.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403


Diagnosed GitHub authentication issue and crafted resolution strategy.




Ah, you have a GitHub authentication issue! You're logged into Git as tony-siqurity-ai but the repo is owned by cybersmrt-tony. Let's fix this:

Quick Fix: Update Your Git Credentials
Step 1: Check Your Current Git Config
bash
# See what account Git thinks you are
git config user.name
git config user.email
Step 2: Remove Old Credentials (Windows/Mac/Linux)
For Windows (Credential Manager):

bash
# Remove cached credentials
git credential-manager erase https://github.com
For Mac (Keychain):

bash
# Remove from keychain
git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
[press Enter twice]
For Linux:

bash
# Remove cached credentials
git credential-cache exit
Step 3: Set Correct Git Identity for This Project
In your cybersmrt-web folder:

bash
# Set your name and email for this specific repository
git config user.name "cybersmrt-tony"
git config user.email "tony@cybersmrt.org"

# Verify it worked
git config user.name
git config user.email
Step 4: Try Pushing Again
bash
git push origin main
You'll be prompted to log in - use your cybersmrt-tony GitHub credentials.

Better Long-Term Solution: SSH Keys
SSH keys are more secure and you won't have to keep entering passwords. Here's the setup:

Step 1: Generate SSH Key
bash
# Generate new SSH key (use your cybersmrt email)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "tony@cybersmrt.org"

# When prompted for file location, press Enter (use default)
# When prompted for passphrase, you can press Enter (no passphrase) or create one
Step 2: Add SSH Key to ssh-agent
Mac/Linux:

bash
# Start ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Windows (Git Bash):

bash
# Start ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

# Add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Step 3: Copy Your Public Key
Mac/Linux:

bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output (starts with ssh-ed25519...)
Windows:

bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Or use: clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (copies to clipboard)
Step 4: Add Key to GitHub
Go to GitHub.com (logged in as cybersmrt-tony)
Click your profile picture → Settings
Click SSH and GPG keys (left sidebar)
Click New SSH key
Title: "CyberSmrt Development Machine"
Key: Paste your public key
Click Add SSH key
Step 5: Switch Your Repo to Use SSH
bash
# Change remote URL from HTTPS to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git

# Verify it changed
git remote -v
Step 6: Test SSH Connection
bash
# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# You should see: "Hi cybersmrt-tony! You've successfully authenticated..."
Step 7: Push Again
bash
git push origin main
Should work perfectly now! 🎉

Quick Troubleshooting
If still getting 403:

Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account in your browser
Check repository ownership:
bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show: cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web
If you have the wrong repository URL:

bash
# Update to the correct one
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git

# Or use SSH (after setting up SSH keys)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git
If branch name is wrong:

bash
# Check your branch name
git branch

# If it says "master" instead of "main", use:
git push origin master

# Or rename your branch to main
git branch -M main
git push origin main
What I Recommend:
Short term: Use Step 1-4 above to fix credentials and push
Long term: Set up SSH keys (more secure, easier workflow)
Let me know which error you hit or if you need help with any step!

Fixed. Let's bulk up the repo with branding folders, blog, news, and other cool things that a cybersecurity non-profit like ours should have


Architected comprehensive repository structure for cybersecurity nonprofit site


Excellent! Let's build out a professional, comprehensive site structure. I'll create the full folder organization and give you the key pages.

Step 1: Create the Folder Structure
In your VS Code terminal, run this to create all folders at once:

bash
# Create main directory structure
mkdir -p assets/{images,logos,brand,fonts}
mkdir -p css
mkdir -p js
mkdir -p pages/{about,programs,blog,news,resources,get-involved}
mkdir -p downloads

# Create placeholder files
touch css/styles.css
touch js/main.js
touch pages/about/team.html
touch pages/about/mission.html
touch pages/about/impact.html
touch pages/programs/k12-curriculum.html
touch pages/programs/mssp-lite.html
touch pages/programs/workforce-dev.html
touch pages/blog/index.html
touch pages/news/index.html
touch pages/resources/index.html
touch pages/get-involved/donate.html
touch pages/get-involved/volunteer.html
touch pages/get-involved/partner.html

## Step 3: Create Additional Key Pages

Let me create a few important pages as examples. I'll make them as artifacts so you can add them to your repo.

Would you like me to create:

1. **Blog page** (with sample blog post layout)
2. **Team page** (with leadership bios)
3. **Programs detail pages** (K-12, MSSP-lite, Workforce)
4. **Resources page** (downloadable materials)
5. **Donate/Get Involved pages**

Which ones should I build first? Or should I create all of them?

Also, do you want me to:
- Extract the CSS from index.html into a separate stylesheet?
- Create a consistent navigation header/footer component?
- Add a blog post template?

Let me know what you'd like to tackle next!

Why does the text inside the ``` not look like a dev font?


Investigated markdown rendering issues for code blocks.




Good catch! The code blocks in your README.md aren't rendering properly. This is likely because of how the markdown is formatted. Let me fix it:

The Issue
When you have a code block inside a numbered list in markdown, you need to indent it with 3 spaces to maintain the list formatting, OR use a language identifier after the triple backticks.

Fixed README.md
Replace your current README.md with this corrected version:

## 🚀 Development

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cybersmrt-tony/cybersmrt-web.git
   cd cybersmrt-web
Open with Live Server in VS Code or run:
bash
   python -m http.server 8000
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
Deployment
This site auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages on every push to main branch.

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added language identifiers**: `bash` after opening triple backticks
2. **Added blank lines** before code blocks in numbered lists
3. **Proper indentation** for code blocks within lists (3 spaces)

## To Update:
```bash
# In VS Code, replace the content of README.md with the version above

# Save and commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Fix: Code block formatting in README"
git push origin main
After pushing, check the README on GitHub - the code blocks should now appear in a proper monospace developer font with syntax highlighting!

The bash commands will be syntax-highlighted and the directory tree structure will maintain its monospace formatting.

Want me to also create a .gitattributes file to ensure consistent line endings and file handling across different operating systems?

The way that it's coming across in the chat isn't right. Can you create the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md in an artifact?


Crafted artifact for README and CONTRIBUTING files.


Planned to create CONTRIBUTING.md as second artifact


Planned additional artifact for brand guidelines document.

Perfect! Now you have all three files as artifacts that you can easily copy. Here's how to add them to your repo:

How to Add These Files:
Option 1: Copy/Paste in VS Code (Recommended)
README.md (root of your repo)
Click the first artifact above
Copy all the content
In VS Code, open your existing README.md or create new one
Paste and save
CONTRIBUTING.md (root of your repo)
Click the second artifact
Copy all the content
Create new file CONTRIBUTING.md in root
Paste and save
BRAND_GUIDELINES.md (in assets/brand/)
Click the third artifact
Copy all the content
Create new file assets/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md
Paste and save
Option 2: Command Line
bash
# Create the brand folder first if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p assets/brand

# Then create/edit each file in VS Code
code README.md
code CONTRIBUTING.md
code assets/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md
Then paste the content from each artifact into the respective file.

Commit and Push
bash
git add README.md CONTRIBUTING.md assets/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md
git commit -m "Add: Documentation and brand guidelines"
git push origin main
Check GitHub
After pushing, go to your GitHub repo and you should see:

✅ Nice formatted README with proper code blocks
✅ Contributing guidelines
✅ Brand guidelines in the assets folder
The code blocks should now render properly with monospace fonts and syntax highlighting!

Ready to create the actual website pages next (blog, team, programs, etc.)?

I only see 1 artifact


Realized artifacts needed separate creation for clarity.

You're right! They're showing as tabs in one artifact viewer. Let me create them as completely separate artifacts:
